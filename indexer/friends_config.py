# Friend Configuration for RocketScope
# Add your friends' gamertags, nicknames, and variations here

# 🎯 INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Replace the example names below with your actual friends' names
# 2. Include common variations and nicknames
# 3. Be careful with very common words (like "Mike") that might cause false positives
# 4. Test with a small list first, then add more

# 👫 YOUR FRIENDS LIST
# Format: 'ExactGamertag'
MY_FRIENDS = [
    # Example entries - replace these with real friend names:
    'YourFriend1',
    'YourFriend2',
    'BestBuddy123',
    'NickName',
    'GamerTag_2024',
    
    # Tips for adding friends:
    # - Include exact Steam/Epic/PSN/Xbox names
    # - Add common short names if they use them
    # - Include clan tags if they use them
    # - Add variations with/without numbers
    
    # Examples of good entries:
    # 'JohnRL',           # Main gamertag
    # 'John',             # Common name they go by  
    # 'Johnny',           # Nickname
    # 'JohnRL2024',       # Seasonal variation
    # '[CLAN]John',       # With clan tag
]

# 🚨 COMMON WORDS TO AVOID:
# Don't add very common words that might appear in normal speech:
# - 'Player', 'Game', 'Team', 'Goal', 'Save', 'Nice', 'Good', 'Bad'
# - Common first names like 'Mike', 'John', 'Alex' (unless very specific context)
